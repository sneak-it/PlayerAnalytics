# PlayerAnalytics
Fork of Dr. McKay's Player Analytics.

Changes:
* SourcePawn Transitional Syntax
* Updated CS:GO gamedata to detect operating system
* CS:GO Prime Status Logging (if game is detected to be CS:GO)
* Removed leftover SteamTools code, replaced with SteamWorks (now optional!)
* Updated default charset to utf8mb4
* Increased name column maximum size to account for emojis being stored (only upon initial db creation)

Original plugin: https://bitbucket.org/Doctor_McKay/public-plugins/src/default/scripting/player_analytics.sp
